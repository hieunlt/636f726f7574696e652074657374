# The Coding Challenge: Concurrent Prime Number Finder

## Description

Write a Go program that finds all prime numbers between 1 and 100,000. Use Goroutines and Channels to parallelize the calculation.

## Requirements:

- Parallelize the computation using 4 worker Goroutines.
- Use Channels to communicate between the Goroutines and the main function.
- Bonus: Implement a simple way to show progress (e.g., using log output).
